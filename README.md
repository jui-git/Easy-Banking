# Easy-Banking
**Easy Banking is a stand alone application.**

The Application is devoloped using the concept of State Transition in
Automata Theory to enhanced the limitation of GUI based application of
tkinter library in Python language. Here the apllication is changing its state(state means GUI interface) with help of some parameters and through the state transition we can able to flow the data (i.e. UDI (unconstrain data item) converts into CDI (constrain data item)) within the system.

**Front end : Python Tkinter**

**Back end : OOD in Python with Sqlite database** 

It depicts the concept of hyperlink just like our web brouser. It overcomes the problem of existance of old GUI and at the same time it is transfering the information to newly generated GUI. I analyzed the limitation in tkinter library and try to come up with a solution with the help of Object Oriented Design using my knowledge and skill.

In future I will try to add the interest concept just like real time banking system.
